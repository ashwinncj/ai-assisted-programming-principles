# AI Assisted Programming Principles
These principles will provide users ways to apply the assisted programming skills and scale up developmentof any kind of tech stack.

## Principle 1: Intent of Programmer.
AI assisted programming requires programmers to understand that AI serves as the assistant to your efforts and coding style, adding value to the code. Hence, the intention of the programmer should be guided towards understanding the concept of implementation of any language modules. In comparison the intent based approach v/s syntactical code expressing, intent of programmer to maximize productivity should be focussed on understanding conceptual implementation which, with the help of AI will be translated into traditional code.

## Principle 2: Expression of intent.
AI assisted programming can be effective when the intent of writing the program is clearly expressed in natural language rather than code. The prediction behavior and autofill capabilities will get activated when the programmer expresses intent to start writing the code/function/class etc. by starting to input/type a few characters/function names/few lines based on which the next lines of the code can be predicted.

## Principle 3: Verb and nouns.
An effective communication method to express intent of a programmer, the parts of speech should be distinguished while expressing. Naming functions in the form of verbs and the variables in the form of nouns is one of the most effective ways to express intent. While the ‘function’ always performs an action, ‘variables’ always hold a value. When a ‘function’ is named appropriately with the action it does, it enables AI to suggest accurate definitions.

## Principle 4: Multiline intents.
When a series of actions needs to be performed to achieve specific results in a code, it is efficient to use multi line intents using comments prior to writing code to get the suggestions. Intent is important for predicting the next line of code and the context provided using multi line intents will generate better results.

## Principle 5: Progression.
AI assist sometimes predicts only a few lines of code ahead of your expressed intents. This indicates that predication is waiting for further inputs from the programmer at the end of the predicted code. It requires progression on the part of the programmer to provide the next line of code/intent for the AI program predication to continue. During modification of existing code, one should remember that the progression might require skills to analyze existing code and provide intents at lines of code which could be further apart from the predicted code.

## Principle 6: Inputs and Expectations.
Expression of intents is better formulated in the form of inputs that will be provided and expressing the desired/expected output from the generated/predicted lines of code. This further helps to modularize the code in units and generate unit tests.

## Principle 7: Validation.
While true that AI assisted programming helps in writing code at a faster pace, it is also true that errors might occur due to misunderstood intents by AI. Hence, it is vital to validate the code after it is predicted and generate tests with set expectations to ensure that cleaner code with fewer mistakes are produced.
